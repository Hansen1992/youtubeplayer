A project I created to practice fething and handling API's in Reactjs.

The app is fetching data using Axios. The data is from the Youtube data API v3. 

I have used Semantic UI to style the project a bit to make it look better when dispalyed, but the main purpose wih the app has been practicing programming in React, so bare with the minimal CSS and general styling.

The idea for the app is from the Udemy course: "Modern React with Redux [2019 update]".
